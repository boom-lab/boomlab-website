Dr. Enrico Milanese is a data scientist working on the NSF CSSI project "CROCODILE". In collaboration with NCAR, the goal is to develop a software infrastructure that facilitates the development of and access to regional model configurations. Enrico focuses on integrating a physical and biogeochemical ocean observations from different sources (floats, gliders, bottle, etc.) into regional models of the northwest Atlantic. 

He has built his expertise in research software development throughout his studies and research in computational mechanics at the University of Padova (Italy), the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland), and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, USA). 

Joining WHOI gives him the sought-after opportunity to contribute to the understanding of our oceans and changing climate. When he is not coding, you can find him running, hiking, making short films, or hanging out with friends spread across the pond.

Shawnee joined the BOOMLAB in 2019 and is earning her doctorate in Chemical Oceanography, specializing on using dissolved gases to better understand the ocean's role in regulating global climate. Her thesis work focuses on 1) novel methods to measure dissolved gases, 2) coastal Arctic greenhouse gas emissions, and 3) the biological carbon pump. She studies these global biogeochemical cycles using a range of tools, from traditional field and lab work to leveraging autonomous platforms such as gliders and biogeochemical floats. She has a special interest in enhancing our observational capabilities in high latitude environments, and her work has brought her to both polar regions.

Prior to joining the BOOMLAB, Shawnee completed her undergraduate studies in environmental chemistry at Columbia University (2018) and worked as a field research assistant at the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER. Her undergraduate research at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory focused around environmental sensing, with applications from urban air and water quality to the carbon dynamics and resiliency of coral reefs [Link text](https://www.college.columbia.edu/about/stories/shawneetraylor). Shawnee is also interested in public outreach through data-driven art. Recent projects include a collaboration with Ennead Architecture Lab [Link text] (http://www.enneadlab.org/projects/water-sampling-station) and serving as the Science and Technology Advisor to New York-based nonprofit +Pool for the launch of a floating public art installation [Link text](https://pluspool.org/programming/details/light-installation/) in the East River.

During my PhD, I worked with large ocean datasets collected by underwater gliders (https://spraydata.ucsd.edu/). At WHOI, I am continuing to work with gliders in the Gulf Stream (http://gliders.whoi.edu/). I have expertise in dissolved oxygen optode sensor measurements and calibration on gliders. I am both interested in pure physical oceanography projects and biogeochemical projects.

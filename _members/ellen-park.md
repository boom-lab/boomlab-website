Ellen is a fourth-year PhD student in chemical oceanography in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program. Broadly, her research uses Biogeochemical Argo floats to better understand carbon and oxygen cycling.

More specifically, her thesis work explores:
- oxygen dynamics in the Labrador Sea
- estimating biological carbon pump parameters in the global ocean
- quantification of sensor dynamic response time

Ellen's research also leverages the power of machine learning to help maximize the utility of observational datasets.

Before pursing her doctorate degree, Ellen completed her undergraduate degree at Cornell University (2020), where she received a B.S. in chemical engineering and a B.S. in earth and atmospheric sciences.

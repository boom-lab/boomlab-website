Dr. Colette Kelly is a Doherty Postdoctoral Scholar in the Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry Department at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Their research centers on understanding marine greenhouse gas cycling through novel laboratory and computational methods. Colette tearned their PhD from Stanford University in 2023, where their thesis research sought to quantify the cycling of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas, in oxygen deficient zones through intramolecular isotope measurements. Their postdoctoral research employs machine learning and autonomous sensor data to quantify marine nitrous oxide emissions on a global scale.

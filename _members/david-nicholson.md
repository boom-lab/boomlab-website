Dr. David (Roo) Nicholson is an Associate Scientist in the Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry Department at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. His research has the broad goal of understanding global biogeochemical cycles in the context of a changing climate. Towards this challenge, his research uses observations from autonomous platforms, such as underwater gliders, floats and surface vehicles and numerical models of varying complexity. In addition, a central focus in the Nicholson Lab is on marine cycles of dissolved gases, including oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane and the noble gases.

Boomlab is leading the development of a system-on-a-chip to measure carbon in seawater, funded by the Arpa-e SEA-CO2 program. The sensor will combine the capabilities of several existing commercial sensors into a single miniature chip, reducing the power requirements and significantly reducing costs. Unlike state-of-the-art sensors that are built in small batches by hand, this new system will permit fabrication and calibration at-scale using semiconductor manufacturing techniques, while still meeting or exceeding current accuracy and precision standards. The project, led by marine chemist David Nicholson is a collaboration with researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, University of Michigan, and Analog Devices, Inc.
